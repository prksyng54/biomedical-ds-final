# Final Project for Biomedical Data Science Course

The dataset consists of multiple types of sequencing data (e.g. chip-seq, bisulfite-seq, and RNA-seq) with the target variable being standardized RNA values from RNA-seq. The dataset is formatted as a gene by modification features (55, 000 x 16) matrix where each entry in the data frame is the relative amount of each modification in each gene. 
Our team wants to use feature selection to reduce the complexity of our histone modification dataset, focusing only on the most impactful modifications that drive gene expression changes. Our goal is to compare different feature selection methods to identify which histone modifications in the dataset are most relevant for building an effective model (i.e. improved accuracy or consistent predictive pattern). By applying relevant metrics within the model and cross-referencing with data on well-studied modifications, we aim to validate this logic and determine the consistency between model-driven insights and established scientific findings.
